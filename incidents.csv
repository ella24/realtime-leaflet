With a short staff due to furloughs, he was recruited to help cover the protests that swept through Cincinnati and the rest of the nation after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.</p><p>Cincinnati police began to enforce a<a href=""https://twitter.com/HCEMA/status/1267537596164517889""> curfew</a> shortly after 8 p.m., the paper<a href=""https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/06/01/cincinnati-enquirer-journalist-detained-during-protest-coverage/5313869002/""> reported</a>. A video provided by Brennan shows a SWAT vehicle advancing as a loudspeaker blares warnings to leave the streets or face arrest. Protesters run away from the police line. Brennan decided to stay put, identify as a journalist, and let the police pass, he told the Tracker.</p><p>His colleague Maddie Mitchell told the Enquirer that Brennan was separated from the group and she called out to him to rejoin. But he suddenly disappeared from view as he crossed behind a police vehicle.</p><p>Brennan had crossed behind the vehicle on the orders of the police, his video shows. Brennan records police arresting two people. One officer tells Brennan to “do what you want but back up.” Brennan says he is trying to reconnect with his crew.

As an officer pulls out plastic restraints to cuff Brennan, Francisco gets quickly caught up herself. The two police officers who previously warned her begin shoving her backwards. The officers force the crew around the corner of a building and out of sight of Brennan.</p><p>“They were pushing very hard and very fast. I couldn’t keep up,” she says to the camera.</p><p>Nick Swartsell, a journalist on furlough from the Cincinnati <i>CityBeat</i>, posted a<a href=""https://twitter.com/nswartsell/status/1267612155840528385""> video</a> on Twitter showing Brennan walk by a police SWAT vehicle toward the police line. Police officers stop Brennan, who is wearing a mask, goggles, and a badge around his neck. A police loudspeaker blares “He’s been told” before the officers take him to the ground.</p><p>Brennan told the Tracker he did his best to avoid face-planting as one officer stuck his leg out to trip him. He collapsed to the ground with the officers, who shoved his cheek into the pavement and cuffed him. Police then brought him to a wall where others were being held.</p><p>The police released Brennan from custody without charge after 30 minutes, according to the Enquirer.</p><p>That night Brennan said on<a href=""https://twitter.com/PBrennanENQ/status/1267656078067720198""> Twitter</a> that he had a “respectful conversation” with Cincinnati’s chief of police, Eliot Isaac.

Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>June 1 was <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/06/01/us/ap-us-america-protests-officers-struck.html?searchResultPosition=20"">a particularly chaotic night in Buffalo</a>. At one point, an SUV carrying two people who had been shot drove through a line of law enforcement officers, two of whom suffered injuries and were taken to a hospital. Blocks away from that incident, police deployed tear gas to clear the streets. In the midst of that, WIVB reporter Dave Greber and photographer Brad Berchou were caught in a volley of pepper ball fire from police. One of the projectiles hit the camera lens, but it was not damaged.</p><p>In an interview with WIVB, Greber said that he did not believe he and Berchou were targeted because they were journalists. “I think they were firing at anything that moved. And we happened to be moving,” he said. “I would hope, to be honest with you, that they didn’t know who we were. It would be a real shame that if they identified us as media positively, and then pulled the trigger.”</p><p>At a press conference, Buffalo police captain Jeff Rinaldo said that any harm journalists suffered during the protests from police was incidental. “We try as hard as we can to make sure that members of the media have access to these events. But when situations like this unfold, when we’re trying to disperse large crowds, there is the potential for media members to become part of the situation,” he said.</p><p>Earlier that evening, a protester giving an on-camera interview to WIVB in front of a line of police with his arms raised above his head was tackled to the ground from behind by officers in riot gear. A New York State Police spokesperson told the station that the man was a “protest antagonist” responsible for instigating the crowd and that officers did not realize the man was being interviewed when they moved to make the arrest.

Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>Pointer told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that she’d been following a group of <a href=""https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-protests-crowds-gather-downtown-4th-day-demonstrations-continue/sSoUsu5ugM3nbuSkzBgXNO/"">protesters</a> marching near City Hall when she realized they intended to try to get on the interstate south of the state Capitol. She heard an officer instruct others to arrest any protester who tried to go down an embankment toward the interstate, she said.</p><p>As the Georgia State Patrol began to make arrests, Pointer said she continued to photograph the scene. After she captured the arrest of two young women, an officer from the DNR demanded to know what she was doing.</p><p>The department, which usually provides law enforcement for outdoor recreation, was one of several state and local agencies assisting the Atlanta Police Department that day, DNR spokesperson Mark McKinnon told the Tracker.</p><p>Pointer responded that she was a journalist with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and said she was heading back up the embankment. Pointer’s press badge hung clearly visible around her neck, she said.</p><p>“I don’t care. You’re being detained,” the DNR officer said, according to Pointer. Two other officers followed that order and proceeded to detain her.</p><p>McKinnon said that two Atlanta Police Department officers told DNR officers to arrest everyone in the area where protesters were blocking traffic on the highway. DNR officers detained Pointer as part of that group.</p><p>Pointer told the Tracker that the officers were not able to handcuff her due to all of her equipment. So they took her two cameras and backpack and placed her in plastic restraints. They then hung her cameras around her neck.</p><p>Journalists walking among the protesters found Pointer sitting with her back against the support of an underpass surrounded by several DNR officers. In a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tvnewsgoon/videos/564953394445546/?v=564953394445546"">livestream video</a> by NBC affiliate 11Alive, reporter Doug Richards spots Pointer and asks, “Whoa, is that Alyssa?”</p><p>Two other journalists were already filming Pointer and talking to the officers. “She’s with the AJC!” Richards shouts in the video. A DNR officer responds that he did not know who detained her or why.</p><p>“It’s as if the story of these guys is that someone cuffed her and then walked away,” Richards explains to his livestream audience.</p><p>A DNR officer, seeing Pointer’s press badge, asked her who detained her. She said she did not know, because the initial officer had left after giving the order. An officer then left to search for his colleague, she said.</p><p>Pointer told the Tracker that one officer wrote down a phone number for her to call once she was taken to jail. “I kept telling him I’m not going,” Pointer said, repeating that she was a journalist. “But they weren’t listening.”</p><p>McKinnon said a DNR supervisor ordered her release after Pointer provided evidence that she was a journalist.</p><p>Pointer’s restraints were removed; she’d been detained for approximately 10 minutes.</p><p>“Bottom line, I was going to jail if the journalists weren’t there,” Pointer told the Tracker.</p><p>Pointer gathered her things and immediately headed up the street to catch up with the protest. She had a <a href=""https://www.ajc.com/news/photos-fourth-day-protests-downtown-atlanta/QEezIBkVD4OHAUrhCca0LM/"">job</a> to do, she said.</p><p>Pointer told the Tracker it was frustrating to know the officers were not listening to her as a journalist or as a black woman.</p><p>“I’m not afraid, but there’s all this legacy of why I possibly should be,” she said. “So listen to a journalist when they tell you who they are. Don’t detain us. Let’s have a conversation.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>After the incident, Burness ran into Hernandez, the Denverite and Colorado Public Radio reporter, near the state capitol building. The lights around the capitol were off, creating an “uneasy” atmosphere, Burness said. A large crowd of protesters had amassed on the north side of the building. Police moved toward protesters, firing tear gas. Burness and Hernandez decided to leave the area, heading away from the tear gas toward the capitol’s south side.</p><p>There, they encountered a line of officers standing across a two-lane street. Burness saw an opening that would have allowed them to leave the area without crossing the police line. “We shouted to them ‘Press!’ several times,” Burness said. Both had press credentials around their necks and Hernandez wore a neon yellow vest with ‘PRESS’ written on it in large letters. “One of the officers points that we have to head the other way, back towards where the tear gas is coming from.” Burness and Hernandez continued to shout “Press! Press! Press!” to get the officers to allow them to pass through the open area. But police refused. In a show of force, one lifted what Burness described as a rifle used to shoot less-lethal projectiles, and pointed it directly at the journalists.</p><p>“There is no doubt in my mind that those officers knew we were press. We were 40 feet away from the guy, we’re shouting press, he’s looking directly at us, he knows what’s up, he still did that,” Burness said, calling the incident “a flagrant disregard for our press rights.”</p><p>The two retreated back towards the capitol lawn, where they were engulfed in a cloud of tear gas. Burness, wearing ski goggles and an N95 mask, said he couldn’t see at more than five percent for several minutes. “It was very intense, extremely unpleasant, and crucially, totally unnecessary,” he said. Both <a href=""https://twitter.com/alex_burness/status/1267319325846917120"">Burness</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/EstebanHRZ/status/1267318923243986945"">Hernandez</a> tweeted about the incident. Reached via direct message on Twitter, Hernandez declined to comment.</p><p>Multiple law enforcement agencies were operating in the area at the time, Burness said, including the Colorado Army National Guard, Denver Police, the Colorado State Patrol, and sheriffs’ departments from various counties across the state. Burness said he believes the officer who trained his gun at them was with the Colorado State Patrol.</p><p>The Tracker reached out to the Colorado State Patrol, which refused to comment on the incidents, saying they involved the Denver Police Department. A request for comment to the Denver Police Department was not immediately returned.</p><p>Burness said while he has lingering bruises from being hit, “I’m much more shaken up by how our rights were disregarded.”</p><p>“Even though there certainly has been much more interest on Twitter and from people who care about me about me being shot at with these foam bullets, the other incident to me, from a press freedom perspective, is significantly more troubling,” Burness said, referring to the officer who pointed the less-lethal rifle at the reporters.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

He asked to speak to a supervisor, and was able to speak with an officer he had previously interviewed. The officer, according to Jojola, said, “I made the call to fire upon you guys, you didn’t look like media.”</p><p>Jojola said he accepted him at his word and left, but on his way down, marveled at how well-lit the area he had been standing was. “I feel that they should have known we were press.

Ray, who had two cameras around his neck, was not wearing a press pass at the time, but doubted that would have helped under the circumstances. The blow “came out of nowhere. It wasn’t a situation where I was being asked to show credentials or anything.”</p><p>The pain from the injury grew throughout the day but had dissipated by the next morning, he said.</p><p>Around 6:46 p.m., Cerise Castle, a reporter for KCRW, a Santa Monica NPR affiliate, was reporting at Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue when she reported being hit by a rubber bullet. She was holding her press badge above her head at the time, she <a href=""https://twitter.com/cerisecastle/status/1266878695555231747?s=19"">tweeted</a>.</p><p>In a statement emailed to the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, Castle said the incident occurred when she was photographing a group of LAPD officers in riot gear who had just arrived in the back of an open truck.</p><p>“As I was snapping photos, the police descended from their vehicle and began pointing rifles at the crowd. People started to run, I held my ground and continued to take pictures. This is when the shooting started, without warning or prior order to disperse,” she wrote. “I screamed after the first gunshot, then pulled myself together and began yelling PRESS and removed my lanyard from my neck, and held it above my head.”</p><p>The rubber bullet that hit her arm above the elbow crease was fired by an officer with whom she had just locked eyes with, she added. As she ran away, she sprained her ankle and is currently on crutches.</p><p>Jintak Han, a photographer and reporter for the Daily Bruin, UCLA’s student newspaper, was wrapping up an afternoon reporting on the protests and trying to cross Beverly Boulevard to head back to his car around 7:15 p.m. when he found himself facing a police line that was clearing protestors block-by-block, he told the Committee to Protect Journalists via Twitter message.</p><p>Han was readily identifiable as a journalist, wearing a press pass, as well as a white helmet and a vest emblazoned with “PRESS,” and carrying three cameras.</p><p>Despite this, he said, an officer aimed his weapon at him, prompting Han to raise both hands in the air. He moved into an opening, and soon was standing “some distance away” from a group of four protestors who were shielding themselves behind a mattress when officers opened fire. “The rubber bullets fell short and hit the ground near my feet before I hid behind the mattress,” he told CPJ.</p></div></div>

Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>While Radzius was reporting alone, he told the Committee to Protect Journalists in a phone interview that he was near a group of reporters during the protests. The protest, one of many that took place across New York City on May 30, began at around 3 p.m. near Prospect Park and continued south to the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush. Radzius characterized the protest as “largely peaceful” in a statement about the incident that he wrote for the police that he provided to CPJ. Radzius said in his interview and in the statement that he had a 1010 WINS microphone and people told him they liked the station and thanked him for reporting on the protest.</p><p>Radzius was carrying press credentials, but they were not displayed, he told CPJ. His 1010 WINS microphone flag was large and identified him clearly as media, he said.</p><p>According to Radzius’ statement to the police, a few hours into the protest, he followed a group of people who left the central location of the protest, thinking them to be protesters. The group and Radzius walked to College Wine and Liquors, a liquor store in Flatbush. Radzius witnessed a group of people loot the store, and filmed the entire incident on his cellphone for 30 seconds, before the store owner locked the door.

Radzius responded that he was talking to “all New Yorkers on the radio.” A few seconds later, Radzius says he heard a male voice shout, “Snitch.” Radzius was then struck from behind on the right side of his upper face.</p><p>Radzius does not know who hit him. A witness told him that the attacker was a man, and that he struck Radzius with an unidentified object.</p><p>After being hit, Radzius says he was “stunned.” He received medical assistance at the scene from a woman who identified herself as a nurse. He later went to the hospital. He sustained injuries to his face that required five stitches above his eye on the eyebrow.

As he ran away from the headquarters through a cloud of tear gas, camera in hand, police began shooting rubber projectiles in his direction.

He was standing behind a light post looking at his cell phone when a flying object he suspects to have been a tear gas canister bounced off the light post before hitting him squarely in the face, on his right eye.

Gray told the Tracker that the officer said something to the effect of, “Alright, no no no, I’ll take him away.”</p><p>Officers then took Gray down the street and passed him off to another officer who was designated his arresting officer and was eventually listed on all of Gray’s arrest reports.</p><p>After being stripped of his equipment and re-cuffed, Gray waited on a prison transport bus with 50 to 60 others for half an hour until the rest of the seats were filled. He said he then waited an additional hour outside One Police Plaza due to the volume of arrestees that night.</p><p>“At this point, I feel like I’m just in the system and we’re going through with it, I’m being booked and that’s what’s happening. There’s nobody else there that I can speak to or remonstrate with,” Gray said.</p><p>After being processed, he was placed in a holding cell with 50-70 people crammed in shoulder-to-shoulder. Gray said that he still had a face mask in order to combat the spread of coronavirus, but most others did not.</p><p>Gray was released at around 9:30 a.m. — nearly 11 hours after his arrest — with a desk appearance ticket for unlawful assembly, a misdemeanor punishable by up to three months in jail and a $500 fine.</p><p>When asked for comment, an NYPD spokesperson directed the Tracker to the “30 minute mark” of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6eUFc_kltc"">a press briefing</a> held by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea on June 3.</p><p>Around that point in the recording, Shea says: “The only thing that I might add on the point of the press: We’re doing the best we can, the difficult situation. We 100 percent respect the rights of the press. Unfortunately we’ve had some people purporting to be press that are actually lying, if you can believe that. So sometimes these things take a second — maybe too long — to sort out.”</p><p>The Manhattan district attorney announced in a <a href=""https://www.manhattanda.org/d-a-vance-declines-to-prosecute-protest-arrests/"">press release</a> on June 5 that his office would not prosecute unlawful assembly or disorderly conduct arrests.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or who had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

<div class=""block-rich_text""><div class=""rich-text""><p>Trahan Martinez told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker that she was standing on a street corner at around 8 p.m. in downtown Dallas, filming demonstrators who were kneeling, when a group of two to three dozen police officers in riot gear approached.</p><p>When someone in the crowd lobbed a water bottle in the direction of the advancing officers, one of the officers issued a warning on his bullhorn to protesters: “Leave the area or you will be arrested.” Seconds later, the police sent canisters of tear gas into the crowd, causing protesters to scatter.</p><p>Trahan Martinez was filming the scene on her phone from a corner opposite the action, when the officers repeated their call to leave, this time in her direction. “I shouted, ‘I’m with the press. I’m media. I’m just working. I’m here doing my job,’” she recounted. When they responded with another command to clear the area, Trahan Martinez reiterated that she was a member of the press, in case they had not heard her.</p><p>“They screamed back, ‘It doesn’t matter,’” she said. Then they fired a canister of tear gas that landed a few feet behind her to her left.</p><p>“They started shooting at me,” she said, recounting that dark blue foam less-lethal projectiles fell at her feet. None of them hit her. Trahan Martinez walked away and took shelter in the patio of a closed restaurant until she was able to reach safety.</p><p>Trahan Martinez, who has worked as a reporter in Dallas for 20 years and has plenty of sources inside the Dallas Police Department, described the experience as a jarring one. “This particular unit did not care who I was or what I was doing there,” she said.</p><p>Reached by the Tracker, Warren Mitchell, a spokesman for the DPD, wrote in an email that it was “challenging” to provide comment about the incident without hearing the details from Trahan Martinez. Mitchell invited the reporter to make a complaint with the department.</p><p>Shortly after, in a nearby part of downtown, Dallas Morning News reporters Corbett Smith and Jesus Jiménez were documenting police efforts to clear out protesters outside of their newspaper’s office when a state trooper rolled a tear gas canister at them.</p><p>Smith said that the incident happened just after 8 p.m., when a state trooper, who was standing 20 to 25 yards away, made eye contact with Smith as the pair stood on South Harwood Street near the The Dallas Morning News headquarters.</p><p>“There&#x27;s a state trooper who turns and looks right at me,” Smith said, “and pulled the pin on the gas.” The trooper <a href=""https://twitter.com/corbettsmithDMN/status/1266899262719303681"">rolled the canister</a> toward Smith and Jiménez, but the canister “kind of skittered off to the west underneath a car that was 10 feet away.” The pair was able to quickly retreat, avoiding being enveloped by the gas.</p><p>There was no one standing between the journalists and the trooper at the time he rolled the canister at them, Smith said.</p><p>Both Smith and Jiménez said they were clearly identifiable as members of the media. “I feel like they could easily distinguish us as press,” Jiménez said. “We had our press passes on, our notebooks out and we were standing right in front of our office.”</p><p>“It was very clear who I was and what I was doing,” Smith said. “I never thought that I would have an officer do something like that.”</p><p>Smith identified the officer as a member of the Texas Department of Public Safety based on the shield he was carrying.</p><p>In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson from the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote in an email that the department “does not have a record of any of our personnel deploying a gas canister in the area of the Dallas Morning News offices in Dallas on the evening of May 30, 2020.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>Ethan Hyman, a photojournalist for the Raleigh News &amp; Observer, started to cover the protest in the city at around 5 p.m.. After briefly returning to the newsroom to file, he went back to cover the protest at around 7. He witnessed confrontations between protesters and police, including officers from the Wake County Sheriff’s Department and the Raleigh Police Department<b>,</b> he told the Committee to Protect Journalists in a phone interview on June 5.</p><p>Hyman says police used tear gas throughout the protest to disperse the crowd. Hyman saw protesters trying to throw canisters back at the police and putting cones over the tear gas to stop it from spreading.</p><p>At around 10:25, Hyman was shooting video when he was struck in the stomach by a projectile.

He was not standing in the direct line of fire and estimates that police were 20 to 30 feet away from him at the time.</p><p>“It was not a very controlled situation,” said Hyman. “The police didn’t seem like they had control either.”</p><p>Hyman was wearing an N95 mask and goggles with a seal when he was struck. He says he doesn’t believe he was targeted for being a journalist.

Simmons was shooting video at the protest in Raleigh, which he said was “peaceful” until around 7:30, when it began to escalate.</p><p>“There was tear gas, people running. People started being a little bit more combative when law enforcement showed up,” Simmons says.</p><p>Simmons witnessed protesters throwing bottles and garbage can lids, as well as breaking windows and storefronts. At around 10:20, he was struck in the left knee by a rubber bullet. He assumes it was fired by police. Simmons estimates he was about 75 feet from police when he was struck. At the time he was struck, he saw many officers in riot gear.</p><p>Simmons doesn’t believe he was targeted for being a member of the media and thinks he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><p>The Raleigh Police Department did not immediately respond to CPJ’s request for comment.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting several hundred total incidents of journalists assaulted, arrested, struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas or had their equipment damaged while covering protests across the country related to the death of George Floyd while in police custody.

The correspondent from his team was also arrested.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker documents all <a href=""http://pressfreedomtracker.us/arrest-criminal-charge/"">arrests</a> separately.</p><p>Multiple days of protests in Minneapolis and across the nation were sparked by a video showing a police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a black man, during an arrest on May 25. Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>Mathieu Derrien, videographer for TF1, a major French television station, told the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker in an interview that he was driving a rental car with his colleague, TF1 correspondent Amandine Atalaya, around Minneapolis just after 11:15 p.m. looking for people to interview when he made a turn off Lake Street.</p><p>A few seconds after making the turn, a foam projectile hit his windshield, damaging it and sending small shards of glass flying inside the car, he told the Tracker. The glass did not injure either journalist. Derrien quickly brought the car to a stop, as a few smaller projectiles—perhaps pepper balls—hit the windshield, leaving behind a white powder.</p><p>Officers then approached the car shouting for Derrien and Atalaya to get out and put their hands up, and they complied. “We immediately told them we were French journalists,” Derrien said. “They replied that they didn’t care and that there was a curfew in place.” The officers pointed their weapons toward the journalists, who showed them their press credentials issued by the U.S. Senate, but the officers were unmoved.</p><p>After securing their hands behind their backs using zip ties, the officers took them to a law enforcement facility across town, Derrien said, where they were fingerprinted and briefly placed in metal handcuffs. He received a citation for misdemeanor curfew violation, which is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or up to 90 days in jail.</p><p>Derrien said that he was unsure which agency the officers who arrested them were from. Emails sent to the Minnesota State Patrol and the Minneapolis Police Department inquiring about this matter were not returned as of press time.</p><p>Jeremy Zoss, a spokesperson for the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, wrote in an email to the Tracker that Derrien was cited at the Hennepin County jail but the sheriff’s office was not the arresting agency. Upon review of the citation, Zoss said that the arresting agency was not listed, something he termed “unusual” and was likely a result of this being a mass arrest.</p><p>The arrest occurred despite the fact that members of the media were specifically exempt from Minnesota Governor Tim Walz’s <a href=""https://mn.gov/governor/news/#/detail/appId/1/id/434117"">executive order</a> implementing the curfew.</p><p>Derrien and Atalaya were released around 2 a.m. and had to find their way back to their car without their cellphones, which were locked inside their vehicle with their gear. A protester who was released at the same time gave them a ride back to the general area where their car was. When they returned to the car, they discovered that one of the tires had been deflated.</p><p>In France, Derrien and Atalaya’s colleagues were “worried sick” when they were unavailable for the live shot they were supposed to do at midnight. “They called our phones many times, so when we got to the car, we had 15 or 20 missed calls each,” Derrien said. “They were starting to imagine the worst.”</p><p>Derrien later <a href=""https://www.liberation.fr/planete/2020/06/04/la-liberte-de-la-presse-doublement-malmenee_1790362"">recounted</a> what transpired to French daily newspaper Libération and tweeted out a photo of the car’s damaged windshield, writing that the situation had left them with “more fear than harm.”</p></div></div>

Why are you pushing us back right now? Can we get some answers as to why you’re pushing us back at this moment?” she asks the officers, camera still rolling. “Where are the crowds supposed to go? You keep pushing them back. Where do people protest peacefully?” One of the officers shouted “move back” in reply.</p><p>Adi then tells the anchor, “So they’re asking us to move back but they’re not giving us answers. If people want to protest, where do you protest?”</p><p>Guajardo declined comment to the Tracker, citing guidance from Denver 7 management.</p><p>A request for comment sent to the Denver Police Department was not returned as of press time.</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting damage of equipment and multiple journalists arrested or struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas while covering related protests across the country.

Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital.</p><p>VanCleave covered the protests in downtown Fort Wayne for several hours. In the evening, as protesters gathered in the street, she said police formed a barricade to keep them from the courthouse lawn. The tension between protesters and police went on for several hours, VanCleave said, and police used tear gas several times.</p><p>VanCleave was part of a group of five journalists with WPTA covering the protests. They had been standing near the police, who were aware the journalists were there, she said. VanCleave and her colleagues were wearing bright red shirts and jackets with the station’s logo. She was carrying equipment, including a camera marked with ABC 21’s letters.</p><p>As protesters and police faced off, without a warning, police began shooting canisters off in every direction, VanCleave said. She began to run and lost the rest of her team.</p><p>She saw one of the canisters, billowing smoke and looking “like a firework,” coming straight toward her face. VanCleave said she turned to duck, and the canister hit her in the back. She couldn’t breathe and had to hunch over. She was also carrying a large camera and a microphone, which made it “impossible” to run, she said.</p><p>VanCleave’s coworker, Kayla Crandall, posted on <a href=""https://twitter.com/Karli_VanCleave/status/1266618555484823554"">Twitter</a> that VanCleave had been struck with a canister while covering the protest.</p><p>The blow from the canister left VanCleave feeling sore the next day. Being close to the tear gas was worse, she said, because she couldn’t breathe or see and her skin felt as though it was burning everywhere.</p><p>VanCleave did not report the incident to police. Though the news organization has been in touch with police about other issues from the protests, she did not believe her experience had been reported.</p><p>Sergeant Brian Walker, the regional public information officer for the Indiana State Police, said in an email that he had looked into the claim, but there was nothing to comment on and confirmed there was no documentation of it.</p><p>VanCleave said police did not give warnings before using tear gas. For both protesters and the press, it was not clear what people were supposed to do to avoid exposure. “We would inch closer and closer so we could get the best shots, and still thinking that we were OK for a little bit to not get tear-gassed,” VanCleave said. “But then it would just happen out of nowhere, it seemed like almost every time.”</p><p>The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker is documenting damage of equipment and multiple journalists arrested or struck by crowd control ammunition or tear gas while covering related protests across the country.
